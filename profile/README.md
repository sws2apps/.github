# TONGASOA üëã

We have been working on small utilities to assist with congregation meeting organization back in 2014. We have started from using Microsoft Excel, and Access and build our first Windows applications. However, in late 2021, we have decided to decomission all those previous applications and utilities, and adopt a new way of building application. Also, we have created Scheduling Workbox System (SWS) team. Our main goal is to provide an easy-to-use application for Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, wether they are appointed brothers, publishers and students for Midweek Meeting.

## Application list

Here are the list of applications that we currently provide. Some of them are not yet publicly available at this time.
